                        i know so many people in life who have immense potential, but the only thing that holds them back is giving up early. i understand it is painful to keep going without immediate results, but your potential is only useful when you don't give up.

                        recently, i watched the movie "srikant," where a blind man overcomes incredible odds to reach mit (usa) and then gives up a promising career there to start his own business in india. this story inspired me deeply and prompted me to write the following thoughts.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        every time you don't get into the university you dreamed of, land the job you desperately sought, win the heart of the person you prayed for, or achieve the success you hoped for in your startup or business, it all boils down to one simple conclusion: either you are capable or incapable. there are no excuses.
                        <br><br>
                        you can't blame your parents for not raising you well, or life for constantly showering problems at you. if a blind man can get into mit, leave behind an outstanding career in america, and start a successful business in india, it proves beyond a doubt that it's all about capability. if you are capable enough, you can achieve anything you want in life.
                        <br><br>
                        excuses and blame are for the weak. if you're not capable enough yet, then take the necessary steps to build yourself up to become capable. that's how you succeed. remember, it's all within your reach if you have the determination and the will to grow. stop giving excuses.
                        <br><br>
